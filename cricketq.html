<p><strong>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_field" title="Cricket field">cricket field</a>,at the centre of which isa rectangular 20-metre (22-yard) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch" title="Cricket pitch">pitch</a> with a target at each end called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket" title="Wicket">wicket</a> (a set of three wooden <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)" title="Stump (cricket)">stumps</a> upon whichtwo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail_(cricket)" title="Bail (cricket)">bails</a> sit). Each phase of play is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings" title="Innings">innings</a>, during which one team <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)" title="Batting (cricket)">bats</a>, attempting to score as many runs as possible,whilst their opponents bowl and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)" title="Fielding (cricket)">field</a>, attempting to minimise the number of runs scored. When each innings ends, the teams usually swap roles for the next innings (i.e. the team that previously batted will bowl/field, and vice versa). The teams each bat for one or two innings, depending on the type of match. The winning team is the one that scores the most runs, including any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(cricket)" title="Extra (cricket)">extras</a> gained (except when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result_(cricket)" title="Result (cricket)">result</a> is not a win/loss result).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before a match begins, the two team <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)" title="Captain (cricket)">captains</a> meet on the pitch for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)" title="Toss (cricket)">toss</a> (of a coin), with the winner deciding which team willbat first. Two players from the batting side, and all eleven players from the bowling/fielding side, then enter the field, and play proceedsby a member of the fielding team, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)" title="Bowling (cricket)">bowler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delivery_(cricket)" title="Delivery (cricket)">delivering</a> (i.e., bowling) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball" title="Cricket ball">ball</a> from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end,which is guarded by one of the batsmen, known as the striker. The striker's role is to strike the ball well enough to score runs, if possible, while not being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissal_(cricket)" title="Dismissal (cricket)">dismissed</a>. The other batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the opposite end of the pitch near the bowler. The bowling team's objectives are to prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman. A dismissed batsman, who is declared to be &quot;out&quot;, must leave the field to be replaced by a teammate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The most common forms of dismissal are these: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled" title="Bowled">bowled</a>, when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball and dislodges the bail(s); <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket" title="Leg before wicket">leg before wicket</a> (lbw),when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught" title="Caught">caught</a>, when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is interceptedby a fielder before touching the ground.Runs are scored by two main methods: either by hitting the ball hard enough for it to cross the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)" title="Boundary (cricket)">boundary</a>, or by the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball.Adjudication is performed on the field by two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(cricket)" title="Umpire (cricket)">umpires</a>, aided by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_umpire" title="Third umpire">Third umpire</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_referee" title="Match referee">Match referee</a> in international matches. They communicate with two off-field<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_(cricket)" title="Scoring (cricket)">scorers</a> (one per team) who record all the match's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_statistics" title="Cricket statistics">statistical information</a> including runs, dismissals, overs, etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forms_of_cricket" title="Forms of cricket">formats</a> ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20" title="Twenty20">Twenty20</a>, played over a few hours with each team batting for a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings" title="Innings">innings</a> of 20 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)" title="Over (cricket)">overs</a> (i.e. 120 delivries), to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket" title="Test cricket">Test matches</a>,played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_clothing_and_equipment" title="Cricket clothing and equipment">kit</a>, but in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket" title="Limited overs cricket">limited overs cricket</a>they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_clothing_and_equipment" title="Cricket clothing and equipment">protective gear</a> to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made ofcompressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather" title="Leather">leather</a> with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(material)" title="Cork (material)">cork</a> core which is layered with tightly wound string.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cricket" title="History of cricket">Historically</a>, cricket's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansionof the British Empire, leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council" title="International Cricket Council">International Cricket Council</a> (ICC),which has over 100 members, twelve of which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_International_Cricket_Council_members" title="List of International Cricket Council members">full members</a> who play Test matches. The game's rules are held in a code called the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_Cricket" title="Laws of Cricket">Laws of Cricket</a></em> which is owned and maintained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marylebone_Cricket_Club" title="Marylebone Cricket Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) in London.</strong></p>
